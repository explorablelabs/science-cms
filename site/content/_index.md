blurb:
    heading: Why Science?
    text: "The Netlify CMS is a wonderfully modular CMS that already allows a huge variety of content types, including images, file upload, geo data, and markdown content. This project extends it to support molecules and charting, so scientists can share their work more easily and show off their beautiful work."
intro:
    heading: "Editable content"
    text: "Most of this is placeholder content, which is easy to edit in the admin interface. It came from the Kaldi template from Hugo. We have replaced the word Kaldi with the word Science throughout this project, leading to some humorous sentences. E.g. Science is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to anyone."

    text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
