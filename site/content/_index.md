blurb:
    heading: Why Science?
    text: "The Netlify CMS is a modular template that allows non-technical users to add a huge variety of content types, including images, file upload, geo data, and text. This project extends it to support molecules and charting, so scientists can share their work more easily."
intro:
    heading: "Editable content"
    text: "Most of this is placeholder content, which is easy to edit in the admin interface. It came from the Kaldi template from Hugo. We have replaced the word Kaldi with the word Science throughout this project, leading to some humorous pages. We hope you like coffee!"

    heading: Information
    text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
